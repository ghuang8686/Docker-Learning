A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, 
including the code, runtime environment, libraries, and system tools. It is built based on the Docker containerization technology.

Docker images are created from a set of instructions called a Dockerfile, which specifies the configuration and dependencies of the desired software environment. 
The Dockerfile contains a series of commands that are executed sequentially to build the image.

docker start -a -i (container ID) # Start an existing container
